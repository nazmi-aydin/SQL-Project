# SQL-Project
In this project, I built a simple IT system for a local delicatessen that is managed by an owner and has multiple staff with
different duties. 

- I first started by designing a database structure. I created possible entities and designed the attributes included in Primary Key and Foreign Keys.

- Then, I finished the ER Diagram by creating the relationships between the entities.

- After transferring the created tables to MySQL, I generated random data for each and added them.

- Last, I built numerical examples using the tables in the database such as Complex Queries, Functions, Procedures and, Triggers.
