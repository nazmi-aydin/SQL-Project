# SQL-Project
In this project, I built a simple IT system for a local delicatessen that is managed by an owner and has multiple staff with
different duties. 

- Started by designing a database structure, created possible entities and designed the attributes included in Primary Key and Foreign Keys.

- Completing an ER Diagram by creating the relationships between the entities.

- transferred the created tables to MySQL, generated random data for each and added them.

- Built numerical examples using the tables in the database such as Complex Queries, Functions, Procedures and, Triggers.
